        That day in August when I met you for the first time is still fresh in
        my memories.<br />
        That day something in me changed and I knew that you were the one I will
        be loving <br />for the rest of my life. Even after all those years I
        wake up with you as my first<br />
        thought and sleep with you in my dreams and nothing else... <br />I
        still hope for you and no one else and want to love you until we're gray
        and old. <br />I'll love and wait for you forever.Even though I irritate
        and stress you out a lot <br />
        thank you for always being there for me and always taking care of me.
        <br />
        You're the one I will adore for the rest of my life. <br />

        All these feelings I just can't hide. <br />
        You'll always be in my heart. <br />
        Can't bear the pain when we are apart. <br />
        Nobody is as special as you are to me. <br />
        I hope you are beginning to see<br />
        Just how much I care for you,<br />
        And all my feelings will always be true. <br />
        I can't describe how much I care, <br />
        But when you need me,<br />
        I'll be there To wipe those tears when you are sad, <br />
        To make you happy when you are mad. <br />All these things I can really
        do. <br />
        Just remember I'm thinking of you!</span
